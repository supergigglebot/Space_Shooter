Welcome to Space Shooter - This is the first game I made using Godot. The base game was made using a YouTube tutorial, and the rest are improvements I made by finding smaller tutorials or diving into the docs. This is technically version 1.2,
as  I'm only just now figuring out how to use GitHub with Godot. If you want to play the base game, you're welcome to follow the same tutorial I did!

If you want to compile this game yourself, just download the full repository, unzip it, and then select "Import" from the Godot launch screen. Navigate to this repository, and you're good to go.

I am SuperGiggleBot on all major social medias, so feel free to reach out if you have any questions. I know I have several.
